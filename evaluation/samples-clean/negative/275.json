In this case, if we unify\n    first, then we (desirably) get the bucket from the key.  If we provide bucket first,\n    something undesirable happens.  The bucket from the connection is used, which means\n    we don't respect the full key provided. Further, the full key is not made relative,\n    which would cause the actual request to fail. For this reason we want to put unify\n    first.\n    \"\"\"\n    if has_conn == \"with_conn\":\n        c = Connection(schema=\"conn_bucket\")\n    else:\n        c = Connection(schema=None)\n    key = \"key.txt\" if key_kind == \"rel_key\" else \"s3://key_bucket/key.txt\"\n    if has_bucket == \"with_bucket\":\n        kwargs = {\"bucket_name\": \"kwargs_bucket\", \"key\": key}\n    else:\n        kwargs = {\"key\": key}\n\n    mock_base.return_value = c\n    if precedence == \"unify\":  # unify to be processed before provide\n\n        class MyHook(S3Hook):\n            @unify_bucket_name_and_key\n            @provide_bucket_name\n            def do_something(self, bucket_name=None, key=None):\n                return bucket_name, key\n\n    else:\n\n        with caplog.at_level(\"WARNING\"):\n\n            class MyHook(S3Hook):\n                @provide_bucket_name\n                @unify_bucket_name_and_key\n                def do_something(self, bucket_name=None, key=None):\n                    return bucket_name, key\n\n        assert caplog.records[0].message == \"`unify_bucket_name_and_key` should wrap `provide_bucket_name`.\"\n    hook = MyHook()\n    assert list(hook.do_something(**kwargs)) == expected",
